About Flockmod :
Flockmod is a flash based online interactive drawing board that started off as a modified version of Flockdraw. It has since grown to become its own fully-fledged application which is now hosted on its own servers, no longer depending on Flockdraw to operate. Flockmod is owned and hosted by FDT, being also co-developed by auto, Moonâ™¥ and pen.
